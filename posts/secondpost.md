Dogs are capable of more than most people think. I saw my dog reading my school books. I swear, it is true. I even left a math problem on the chalkboard. He solved it! I did the same, and he solved that one, too. I went from being really upset that I couldn’t get him to stop licking me to feeling really proud that he could do it. It’s great that he knows how to do math, too. You can teach them a lot of things.

They’re best friends forever. Just because your dog is supposed to eat dinner and go to bed doesn’t mean that he doesn’t love you, too. When we were staying at my parents’ house a couple years ago, they were having some of the cable removed. My mom got a scanner and did some work for us. My dad took the opportunity to teach my sister and I some gymnastics.
